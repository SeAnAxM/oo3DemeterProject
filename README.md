<b>PROJECT TITLE:</b> Chasing Change: The Escape Room for World Changers <br><br>
<b>SDG:</b> Quality Education <br><br>
<b>Team Leader:</b> Sean Alexander Morales <br><br>
<b>PROJECT OVERVIEW:</b><br>
  "Chasing Change: The Escape Room for World Changers" is an immersive, virtual "Escape Room" experience designed to educate, inspire, and promote the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. This application revolutionizes the concept of an 'Escape Room' game, transforming it into an immersive, world-altering journey. Players aren't just escaping rooms; they're unlocking the doors to a sustainable future, solving puzzles that mirror the real-world challenges of creating a better, more equitable planet. Participants will navigate a series of themed rooms, each corresponding to a specific SDG (the total amount of SDGs implemented in the application may vary due to time constraints) (at least 5) . The goal is to solve puzzles, complete tasks corresponding to that SDG goal, and clear the room. With a blend of entertainment and education, the game facilitates a deeper understanding of sustainability issues while fostering a sense of urgency to tackle global challenges. A leaderboard will showcase the best records, encouraging friendly competition and recurring participation. <br><br>
